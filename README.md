Making a quiz using a little css and a lot of JavaScript!
   
        In this project, I was tasked to make a quiz about coding. At the end of the quiz, it should display a scoreboard saying
    how many total questions you got correct.

Getting Started

    To get started with this project, the only thing needed was VS code, a computer, and the acceptance criteria. 

-Side note, I am having trouble getting each set of questions to show after clicking the next button. I will figure it out
and update the deployed application within a few days!

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
